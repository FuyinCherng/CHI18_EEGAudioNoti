## Abstract
Well-designed notifications can successfully inform users of various devices and systems about their status; however, poorly designed ones can lead to negative user experiences. 
In this study, we conducted electroencephalography and behavioral experiments to understand how three musical parameters -- harmonic richness, pitch, and tempo -- influence users' auditory perception and attention-shifting. By understanding the relation between changes of musical parameters and users' cognitive and behavioral responses, the designers could better assess the possible cognitive effects caused by their manipulation of these parameters. We hope that the findings of this study can serve as cognitive implications for audio-notification designers and help them to explore the design space more efficiently.
